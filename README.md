The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang.
It is being used to build `Gaia`, the first implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

**WARNING**: The SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some
breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.12+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Quick Start

To learn how the SDK works from a high-level perspective, go to the [SDK Intro](./docs/intro/README.md).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of the SDK, please follow the [SDK Application Tutorial](https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-application-tutorial). You can also fork the tutorial's repo to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

For more, please go to the [Cosmos SDK Docs](./docs/README.md)
